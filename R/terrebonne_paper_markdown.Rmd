# Data Exploration

This markdown document is for sharing the data exploration and analyses completed for the Terrebonne Bay marsh fragmentation paper tentatively titled : "Relating Marsh Fragmentation to Emergent and Submerged Vegetation Cover in a Rapidly Changing Coastal Landscape".

Data was collected in April and September of 2016, at/near 3 CRMS sites (311, 345, 369), each representing areas of high, intermediate, and low annual salinity measurements. Within each site there were 9 sub-sites chosen which spanned the degree of marsh fragmentation at each site.

## Emergent Vegetation
At each of these subsites data was collected on the diversity and richness of emergent vegetation at 21 stations. At each station a 5m transect was surveyed, with quadrats done at 0m, 2.5m, and 5m from the marsh edge, recording the percent cover of each species present. Elevation was recorded during the April sampling period.

## Open Water Survey Data
At each subsite 20 open water stations were sampled to document submerged aquatic vegetation presence and record water quality parameters (depth, salinity, temperature, do, PAR)

## CRMS site data
At each site a hydrographic datalogger records hourly data on certain water quality parameters which can be used to get yearly/monthly/daily averages for the site. The available parameters include: temperature, salinity, conductance, water level, and marsh mat elevation.

# Calculating Light Attenuation

The Texas seagrass monitoring protocols give two equations to use with the Li-cor PAR measurements:   

1. Percent surface irradiance available at the seagrass canopy is calculated as follows:   
$$\%SI=(i_z/i_o) * 100$$
This equation gives the percent of light lost between measurements at depth $I_z$ and at the surface $I_0$, and ranges from 0-1.   

2. Light attenuation is calculated using the transformed Beer-Lambert equation:  
$$ k_d = \frac{-[ln(Iz/Io)]}{z} $$ 
where k is the attenuation coefficient (m-1) and Iz and I0 are irradiance (Âµmol photons m-2 sec-1) at
depth z (meters) and at the surface, respectively. With a distance of z=0.15 between bulbs, $k_d$ calculates for attenuation per 15cm and doesn't necessarily scale 0-1.

red = bottom bulb has greater value than top bulb for surface measurement or top_par2 > top_par1   
blue = bot_par_2 > bot_par_1
